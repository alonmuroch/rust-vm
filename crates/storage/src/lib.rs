/// Represents persistent storage for the blockchain virtual machine.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This struct provides a simple key-value storage
/// system that simulates how blockchain systems store persistent data.
/// In real blockchains, this would be implemented using databases, file
/// systems, or distributed storage systems.
/// 
/// STORAGE CONCEPTS:
/// - Key-value pairs for simple data storage
/// - Persistent across VM restarts
/// - Thread-safe access using RefCell
/// - Ordered storage using BTreeMap
/// - Domain-based storage organization
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD BLOCKCHAIN COMPARISON:
/// In Ethereum, storage is organized differently:
/// - Each contract has its own storage space
/// - Storage is accessed via 32-byte keys and values
/// - Storage is part of the global state trie
/// - Gas costs are associated with storage operations
/// 
/// MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Uses BTreeMap for ordered iteration and efficient
/// lookups. The RefCell wrapper provides interior mutability, allowing
/// the storage to be modified even when borrowed immutably.
/// 
/// PERSISTENCE: This is an in-memory implementation. In production,
/// data would be persisted to disk or a database to survive system
/// restarts and crashes.
/// 
/// THREAD SAFETY: The current implementation is not thread-safe. In a
/// real blockchain, storage would need to handle concurrent access
/// from multiple transactions and validators.
