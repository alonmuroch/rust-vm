/// Represents the global state of the blockchain virtual machine.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This struct manages all accounts in the blockchain,
/// similar to how Ethereum's state trie works. It's the central data structure
/// that tracks all accounts, their balances, code, and storage.
/// 
/// BLOCKCHAIN STATE CONCEPTS:
/// - Each address can have an account
/// - Accounts can be regular (hold value) or contracts (hold code)
/// - All state changes are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
/// - State persists between transactions
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD BLOCKCHAIN COMPARISON:
/// This is a simplified version of Ethereum's state management. In Ethereum:
/// - State is stored in a Merkle Patricia Trie for efficient proofs
/// - Accounts have additional fields like storage root and code hash
/// - State changes are tracked for rollback capability
/// - Gas costs are associated with state operations
/// 
/// DATA STRUCTURE: Uses a HashMap for O(1) account lookups by address.
/// In production blockchains, this would be a more sophisticated data structure
/// like a Merkle tree for efficient state proofs.
/// 
/// MEMORY MANAGEMENT: All accounts are kept in memory for fast access.
/// In production systems, only frequently accessed accounts would be in memory,
/// with the rest stored on disk or in a database.
/// 
/// THREAD SAFETY: This implementation is not thread-safe. In a real blockchain,
/// the state would need to handle concurrent access from multiple transactions
/// and validators.
/// 
/// PERSISTENCE: The state can be reconstructed from storage, though the current
/// implementation is simplified. Real blockchains use sophisticated persistence
/// mechanisms to ensure data durability and recovery.
