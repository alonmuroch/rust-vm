/// - Each address can have an account
/// - Accounts can be regular (hold value) or contracts (hold code)
/// - All state changes are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
/// - State persists between transactions
/// 
/// DATA STRUCTURE: Uses a HashMap for O(1) account lookups by address.
/// In production blockchains, this would be a more sophisticated data structure
/// like a Merkle tree for efficient state proofs.
