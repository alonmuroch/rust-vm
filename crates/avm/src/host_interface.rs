// HostShim is a lightweight adapter that allows a VM to call back into the AVM.
// It implements the HostInterface trait and holds a raw pointer to the AVM.
//
// We use a raw pointer (*mut AVM) instead of &'a mut AVM to avoid borrow checker conflicts.
// This is necessary because AVM::call_contract creates new VMs, which also require access
// to the AVM via HostInterface. If we used &'a mut AVM, weâ€™d get lifetime or multiple mutable
// borrow errors due to recursive calls.
//
// By using *mut AVM:
// - We avoid tracked mutable borrows
// - We preserve safety by ensuring the pointer is only dereferenced during the call
// - We allow recursive VM execution without violating Rust's ownership model
//
// This approach is safe in our case because:
// - Each VM invocation gets its own HostShim
// - The pointer never escapes its VM or outlives AVM
// - We do not access AVM concurrently or from multiple threads
