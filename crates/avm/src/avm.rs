/// Application Virtual Machine (AVM) - the main orchestrator for smart contract execution.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This struct represents a complete blockchain virtual machine
/// that can execute smart contracts. It's similar to Ethereum's EVM or other blockchain VMs.
/// 
/// AVM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
/// - Context Stack: Manages nested contract calls (like a call stack in programming)
/// - Memory Manager: Allocates and manages memory pages for contract execution
/// - Storage: Global persistent storage shared across all contracts
/// - State: Manages accounts, balances, and contract code
/// 
/// BLOCKCHAIN CONCEPTS:
/// - Each contract has its own account with code and storage
/// - Transactions can create accounts or call existing contracts
/// - Contracts can call other contracts (nested execution)
/// - All state changes are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
/// 
/// SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
/// - Panic handling prevents one bad contract from crashing the entire system
/// - Memory isolation between contracts prevents interference
/// - Input validation prevents resource exhaustion attacks
