/// This enum defines the full instruction set for RV32IMAC
/// (Integer, Multiplication, Atomic, and Compressed extensions).
/// Each variant corresponds to a decoded instruction
/// from either a 32-bit or 16-bit RISC-V word.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This enum represents the complete instruction set
/// that our RISC-V virtual machine can execute. Understanding this structure
/// helps students learn about:
/// - CPU instruction formats and encoding
/// - Different types of operations (arithmetic, memory, control flow)
/// - How high-level programming constructs map to machine instructions
/// 
/// RISC-V INSTRUCTION FORMATS:
/// - R-type: Register operations (add, sub, and, or, etc.)
/// - I-type: Immediate operations (addi, lw, jalr, etc.)
/// - S-type: Store operations (sw, sh, sb)
/// - B-type: Branch operations (beq, bne, blt, etc.)
/// - U-type: Upper immediate operations (lui, auipc)
/// - J-type: Jump operations (jal)
/// 
/// INSTRUCTION CATEGORIES:
/// - ARITHMETIC: Basic math operations (add, sub, mul, div)
/// - LOGICAL: Bit manipulation (and, or, xor, shifts)
/// - MEMORY: Load and store operations
/// - CONTROL FLOW: Branches and jumps
/// - SYSTEM: Environment calls and breakpoints
/// - ATOMIC: Thread-safe memory operations
/// - COMPRESSED: 16-bit versions of common instructions
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD CONTEXT: In actual RISC-V processors, these instructions
/// are encoded as binary data. The decoder converts these binary patterns
/// into this enum structure, which makes them easier to work with in our VM.
/// 
/// PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS: Different instruction types have different
/// execution costs. Memory operations are typically slower than register
/// operations, and branches can cause pipeline stalls in real CPUs.
