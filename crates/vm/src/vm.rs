/// - CPU: Executes RISC-V instructions
/// - Memory: Provides RAM for the running program
/// - Storage: Persistent storage for data that survives between runs
/// 
/// MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Uses Rc<RefCell<>> for shared mutable access to memory
/// and storage, allowing the VM to manage resources efficiently while maintaining
/// Rust's safety guarantees.
