/// EDUCATIONAL: RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Opcodes
/// 
/// This enum defines the primary opcodes used in RISC-V instruction encoding.
/// Each opcode represents a category of instructions that share the same basic format.
/// 
/// RISC-V INSTRUCTION ENCODING:
/// - All RISC-V instructions are 32 bits (or 16 bits for compressed instructions)
/// - The bottom 7 bits contain the opcode, which determines the instruction format
/// - Different opcodes use different instruction formats (R, I, S, B, U, J)
/// 
/// INSTRUCTION FORMATS:
/// - R-type: Register operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.)
/// - I-type: Immediate operations (ADDI, LW, JALR, etc.)
/// - S-type: Store operations (SW, SH, SB)
/// - B-type: Branch operations (BEQ, BNE, BLT, etc.)
/// - U-type: Upper immediate operations (LUI, AUIPC)
/// - J-type: Jump operations (JAL)
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD CONTEXT: In actual RISC-V processors, these opcodes are encoded
/// as binary values in the instruction word. The decoder uses these opcodes
/// to determine how to interpret the rest of the instruction bits.
