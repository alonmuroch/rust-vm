/// Represents a function call with a selector (function ID) and arguments.
/// This is the core data structure for routing function calls in our VM.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL NOTE: In virtual machines, we often need to call different functions
/// based on a selector (like a function ID). This struct holds the selector and
/// the raw bytes that represent the function arguments. The lifetime 'a ensures
/// the args reference stays valid as long as the input data exists.
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: Think of this like a function pointer in C, but with
/// additional metadata. Instead of just having a pointer to a function, we have
/// both the function identifier (selector) and its arguments bundled together.
/// This is similar to how web APIs work - you send a request with a method name
/// (like "GET" or "POST") and some data, and the server routes it to the right handler.
/// 
/// BLOCKCHAIN CONTEXT: In smart contracts, this pattern is used extensively.
/// When you call a smart contract, you don't call a specific function by name.
/// Instead, you send a transaction with a selector (usually the first 4 bytes
/// of the function signature hash) and the encoded arguments. The contract's
/// router then uses this selector to determine which function to execute.
/// 
/// MEMORY EFFICIENCY: Using a reference (&'a [u8]) instead of owned data (Vec<u8>)
/// means we don't need to copy the argument data. This is crucial in embedded
/// systems and VMs where memory is limited and copying can be expensive.

/// Decodes a sequence of function calls from a binary input buffer.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This function demonstrates how to parse a binary protocol
/// where multiple function calls are packed into a single buffer. This is common
/// in blockchain VMs and RPC systems.
/// 
/// BINARY FORMAT EXPLANATION:
/// Each function call is encoded as: [selector: u8][arg_len: u8][args: arg_len bytes]
/// - selector: Which function to call (0-255)
/// - arg_len: How many bytes of arguments follow
/// - args: The actual argument data
/// 
/// EXAMPLE: If you want to call function 0x01 with arguments [1, 2, 3, 4], the
/// binary encoding would be: [0x01][0x04][0x01][0x02][0x03][0x04]
/// 
/// BATCH PROCESSING: This function can decode multiple function calls from a
/// single buffer. This is useful for batch transactions where you want to
/// execute several operations atomically (all succeed or all fail).
/// 
/// MEMORY LAYOUT: The function uses a pre-allocated buffer to avoid dynamic
/// memory allocation. This is important in embedded systems and VMs where
/// heap allocation can be expensive or unavailable.
/// 
/// SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
/// - We validate buffer bounds to prevent out-of-bounds access
/// - We check for incomplete headers and malformed data
/// - We limit the number of calls to prevent buffer overflow
/// - We use Rust's type system to ensure memory safety
/// 
/// ERROR HANDLING: When invalid data is encountered, the function calls vm_panic
/// to halt execution. This is appropriate for VM environments where continuing
/// with invalid data could lead to undefined behavior.
/// 
/// PARAMETERS:
/// - input: The binary buffer containing encoded function calls
/// - buffer: Pre-allocated array to store decoded FuncCall structs
/// 
/// RETURNS: Number of successfully decoded function calls

/// Generic router that takes the input buffer and a closure to dispatch each call.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This function demonstrates the power of Rust's generic
/// programming and closures. It's a higher-order function that can work with
/// any handler function you provide.
/// 
/// DESIGN PATTERN: This implements the "Strategy Pattern" where the routing
/// logic is separated from the actual function handling logic. This makes the
/// code more modular and testable.
/// 
/// TWO-PHASE EXECUTION: The function works in two phases:
/// 1. DECODE PHASE: Parse all function calls from the input buffer
/// 2. EXECUTE PHASE: Run each function call through the provided handler
/// 
/// This separation allows for better error handling and ensures that all
/// calls are properly decoded before any execution begins.
/// 
/// CLOSURE PATTERN: The handler parameter is a closure (impl FnMut), which means
/// it can capture variables from its environment. This is powerful because it
/// allows the router to work with any context it needs (like a VM state, database
/// connection, etc.) without hardcoding those dependencies.
/// 
/// MEMORY MANAGEMENT: We use a fixed-size array to avoid heap allocations,
/// which is important in embedded systems and VMs where memory is constrained.
/// 
/// BATCH SEMANTICS: All function calls in a batch are processed, even if some fail.
/// This is different from traditional transaction semantics where one failure
/// would roll back the entire batch. This design choice allows for partial
/// success scenarios and better error reporting.
/// 
/// ERROR HANDLING: Each function call can succeed or fail, but we continue
/// processing all calls and return the result of the last one. This ensures
/// that one bad function call doesn't stop the entire batch.
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD USAGE: This pattern is used in many systems:
/// - Web servers that process multiple requests in a batch
/// - Database systems that execute multiple queries atomically
/// - Blockchain VMs that process multiple contract calls
/// 
/// PARAMETERS:
/// - input: Binary buffer containing encoded function calls
/// - max_calls: Maximum number of calls to process (safety limit)
/// - handler: Closure that processes each individual function call
/// 
/// RETURNS: Result of the last processed function call
