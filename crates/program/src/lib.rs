/* --------------------------- Assertion Utilities -------------------------- */

/// Aborts execution if condition is false, printing `msg`.
/// 
/// EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE: This function demonstrates defensive programming in VM environments.
/// In virtual machines, especially those running untrusted code, we need to validate
/// all inputs and assumptions to prevent security vulnerabilities and crashes.
/// 
/// DESIGN PATTERN: This is an "assertion" or "guard clause" pattern. Instead of
/// letting invalid conditions cause undefined behavior later, we fail fast with
/// a clear error message. This makes debugging much easier.
/// 
/// DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES:
/// - Validate all inputs at function boundaries
/// - Check preconditions before performing operations
/// - Provide clear, actionable error messages
/// - Fail fast to prevent cascading errors
/// - Assume all external data is potentially malicious
/// 
/// SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
/// - Always validate inputs before processing them
/// - Provide clear error messages for debugging
/// - Fail fast to prevent cascading errors
/// - In production VMs, you might want to log these failures for monitoring
/// - Consider rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks
/// 
/// REAL-WORLD ANALOGY: This is like a bouncer at a club checking IDs. Instead
/// of letting people in and then dealing with problems later, you check
/// everything upfront and turn away anyone who doesn't meet the requirements.
/// 
/// USAGE EXAMPLES:
/// - require(data.len() >= 8, b"insufficient data");
/// - require(account.balance >= amount, b"insufficient funds");
/// - require(selector < MAX_SELECTORS, b"invalid selector");
/// - require(caller == owner, b"unauthorized access");
/// 
/// PARAMETERS:
/// - condition: Boolean expression that must be true for execution to continue
/// - msg: Error message to display if condition is false (as bytes for no_std compatibility)
/// 
/// BEHAVIOR: If condition is false, the VM will panic with the provided message
/// and halt execution. This prevents the VM from continuing with invalid state.
