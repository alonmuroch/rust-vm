# rust-vm

**rust-vm** is a minimal, modular blockchain virtual machine written in Rust. It executes smart contracts compiled from Rust to a custom RISC-V-based bytecode.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **RISC-V Instruction Set** — Uses the RV32I base integer instruction set for simplicity and extensibility.
- 🦀 **Rust Smart Contracts** — Contracts are written in Rust and compiled directly to VM bytecode (not via WebAssembly).
- 🪶 **Minimal Design** — Built for clarity, portability, and experimentation.
- 🔐 **Deterministic Execution** — Designed for blockchain environments with strict determinism.
- 📦 **Modular Architecture** — Easy to extend with custom opcodes or execution layers.
