# 🚀 Rust VM: Learn Blockchain Virtual Machines from the Ground Up

> **"The best way to understand how something works is to build it yourself."**

**rust-vm** is an educational blockchain virtual machine written in Rust that teaches you how virtual machines, smart contracts, and blockchain systems actually work. Instead of just reading about these concepts, you can explore a real implementation with comprehensive documentation that explains every design decision.
