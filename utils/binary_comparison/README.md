# Binary Comparison Tool

A CLI utility for comparing verbose VM execution logs with actual ELF binaries to identify instruction-level differences.

## Purpose

This tool helps debug and verify the VM implementation by comparing:
- Instructions executed by the VM (from verbose logs)
- Instructions in the original ELF binaries
- Identifying mismatches in instruction decoding or execution

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
cargo run -- -b <binaries_folder> -l <log_file>

# Example
cargo run -- -b ../../crates/examples/bin -l /Users/alonmuroch/Desktop/logs.txt

# Show only differences
cargo run -- -b ../../crates/examples/bin -l logs.txt --diff-only

# Export results as JSON
cargo run -- -b ../../crates/examples/bin -l logs.txt --format json
```

## Arguments

- `-b, --binaries-folder`: Path to folder containing ELF binaries
- `-l, --log-file`: Path to verbose log file from program_exec test
- `-f, --format`: Output format (text or json, default: text)
- `-d, --diff-only`: Show only differences, skip matching instructions

## How It Works

1. **Parse Verbose Logs**: Extracts instruction sequences from VM execution logs
2. **Decode ELF Binaries**: Reads and decodes RISC-V instructions from ELF files
3. **Compare Instructions**: Matches instructions by PC address and compares:
   - Raw instruction bytes
   - Decoded instruction text
   - Instruction types and operands
4. **Generate Report**: Produces a summary showing:
   - Match percentage
   - Types of differences
   - Instruction statistics

## Output

The tool provides:
- Per-test comparison results
- Overall summary statistics
- Detailed difference analysis
- Optional JSON export for further processing

## Example Output

## Integration with Tests

The tool uses centralized ELF binary definitions from `crates/examples/tests/elfs.rs`, ensuring consistency between test execution and binary comparison.
