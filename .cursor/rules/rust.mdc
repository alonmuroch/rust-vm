# Rules for Rust files
description: Rust project style and safety guidelines
globs: "**/*.rs"
alwaysApply: false
rules:
  - Follow `no_std` conventions; avoid importing `std`.
  - Do not use `unsafe` unless explicitly allowed.
  - Use `Result<T, E>` for error handling; avoid panics.
  - All public functions must have doc comments.
  - Use `snake_case` for functions, variables, and fields.
  - Use 4-space indentation.
  - Avoid dynamic memory allocations unless required.
  - Keep function bodies under 50 lines if possible.
  - Be conservative in code changing, do not change unrelated code or functions
  - Be specific in the changes you make relevant to what you've been asked to do
